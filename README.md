# 🌱 **Plant Disease Detector**  

🚀 An AI-powered application for detecting **plant diseases** from leaf images using **TensorFlow** and **Gradio**.  
This app leverages **fine-tuned deep learning models (ResNet & VGG)** to identify plant diseases with high accuracy.  



# ✨ **Features**  

- ✅ **Disease Prediction** – Upload a plant leaf image and get:  
  - Predicted disease name  
  - Confidence score (%)  

- ✅ **Interactive Web Interface** – Built with **Gradio** for easy use.  

- ✅ **Pre-trained Models** – Utilizes **ResNet** and **VGG (fine-tuned)** models.  



# 📂 **Project Structure**  

- `app.py` : Main Gradio application.  
- `requirements.txt` : Python dependencies.  
- `README.md` : Project documentation.  

👉 Models are hosted on **Hugging Face**:
